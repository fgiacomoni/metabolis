	abstract = {Motivation: The molecular complexity of a tumor manifests itself at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Genomic profiling at these multiple levels should allow an integrated characterization of tumor etiology. However, there is a shortage of effective statistical and bioinformatic tools for truly integrative data analysis. The standard approach to integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual integration. A more statistically powerful approach would incorporate all data types simultaneously and generate a single integrated cluster assignment.Methods: We developed a joint latent variable model for integrative clustering. We call the resulting methodology iCluster. iCluster incorporates flexible modeling of the associations between different data types and the variance–covariance structure within data types in a single framework, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of the datasets. Likelihood-based inference is obtained through the Expectation–Maximization algorithm.Results: We demonstrate the iCluster algorithm using two examples of joint analysis of copy number and gene expression data, one from breast cancer and one from lung cancer. In both cases, we identified subtypes characterized by concordant DNA copy number changes and gene expression as well as unique profiles specific to one or the other in a completely automated fashion. In addition, the algorithm discovers potentially novel subtypes by combining weak yet consistent alteration patterns across data types.Availability: R code to implement iCluster can be downloaded at http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/85130.cfmContact: shenr@mskcc.orgSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

This study aims to elucidate the pathogenesis and assess early prediction of tPE using serial integrated metabolomic and proteomic systems biology approaches. Serial first- (11–14 weeks) and third-trimester (30–34 weeks) serum samples were analyzed using targeted metabolomic (1H NMR and DI-LC-MS/MS) and proteomic (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) platforms. We analyzed 35 tPE cases and 63 controls. Serial first- (sphingomyelin C18:1 and urea) and third-trimester (hexose and citrate) metabolite screening predicted tPE with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (95\% CI) = 0.817 (0.732–0.902) and a sensitivity of 81.6\% and specificity of 71.0\%. Serial first [TATA box binding protein-associated factor (TBP)] and third-trimester [Testis-expressed sequence 15 protein (TEX15)] protein biomarkers highly accurately predicted tPE with an AUC (95\% CI) of 0.987 (0.961–1.000), sensitivity 100\% and specificity 98.4\%. Integrated pathway over-representation analysis combining metabolomic and proteomic data revealed significant alterations in signal transduction, G protein coupled receptors, serotonin and glycosaminoglycan metabolisms among others. This is the first report of serial integrated and combined metabolomic and proteomic analysis of tPE. High predictive accuracy and potentially important pathogenic information were achieved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) samples holds great promise to diagnose neurological pathologies and gain insight into the molecular background of these pathologies. Proteomics and metabolomics methods provide invaluable information on the biomolecular content of CSF and thereby on the possible status of the central nervous system, including neurological pathologies. The combined information provides a more complete description of CSF content. Extracting the full combined information requires a combined analysis of different datasets i.e. fusion of the data.RESULTS:A novel fusion method is presented and applied to proteomics and metabolomics data from a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis: an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in rats. The method follows a mid-level fusion architecture. The relevant information is extracted per platform using extended canonical variates analysis. The results are subsequently merged in order to be analyzed jointly. We find that the combined proteome and metabolome data allow for the efficient and reliable discrimination between healthy, peripherally inflamed rats, and rats at the onset of the EAE. The predicted accuracy reaches 89\% on a test set. The important variables (metabolites and proteins) in this model are known to be linked to EAE and/or multiple sclerosis.CONCLUSIONS:Fusion of proteomics and metabolomics data is possible. The main issues of high-dimensionality and missing values are overcome. The outcome leads to higher accuracy in prediction and more exhaustive description of the disease profile. The biological interpretation of the involved variables validates our fusion approach.},

	abstract = {Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field consisting of the analysis of a large number of metabolites at a system scale. The two major goals of metabolomics are the identification of the metabolites characterizing each organism state and the measurement of their dynamics under different situations (e.g. pathological conditions, environmental factors). Knowledge about metabolites is crucial for the understanding of most cellular phenomena, but this information alone is not sufficient to gain a comprehensive view of all the biological processes involved. Integrated approaches combining metabolomics with transcriptomics and proteomics are thus required to obtain much deeper insights than any of these techniques alone. Although this information is available, multilevel integration of different ‘omics’ data is still a challenge. The handling, processing, analysis and integration of these data require specialized mathematical, statistical and bioinformatics tools, and several technical problems hampering a rapid progress in the field exist. Here, we review four main tools for number of users or provided features (MetaCoreTM, MetaboAnalyst, InCroMAP and 3Omics) out of the several available for metabolomic data analysis and integration with other ‘omics’ data, highlighting their strong and weak aspects; a number of related issues affecting data analysis and integration are also identified and discussed. Overall, we provide an objective description of how some of the main currently available software packages work, which may help the experimental practitioner in the choice of a robust pipeline for metabolomic data analysis and integration.},

However, at present, there is no format to describe the final qualitative and quantitative results for proteomics and metabolomics experiments in a simple tabular format. Many downstream analysis use cases are only concerned with the final results of an experiment and require an easily accessible format, compatible with tools like Microsoft Excel or R. We developed the mzTab file format for MS-based proteomics and metabolomics results to meet this need. mzTab is intended as a lightweight supplement to the existing standard XML-based file formats (mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML), providing a comprehensive summary, similar in concept to the supplementary material of a scientific publication. mzTab files can contain protein, peptide, and small molecule identifications together with experimental metadata and basic quantitative information. The format is not intended to store the complete experimental evidence but provides mechanisms to report results at different levels of detail. This ranges from a simple summary of the final results up to a representation of the results including the experimental design. This format is ideally suited to make MS-based proteomics and metabolomics results available to a wider biological community outside the field of MS. Several software tools for proteomics and metabolomics have already adapted the format as an output format.

(2001) A new approach to decoding life: systems biology. 2, 343–372). A number of studies have demonstrated the parallel analysis of metabolites and large scale transcript expression. Protein analysis has been ignored in these studies, although a clear correlation between transcript and protein levels is shown only in rare cases, necessitating that actual protein levels have to be determined for protein function analysis. Here, we present an approach to investigate the combined covariance structure of metabolite and protein dynamics in a systemic response to abiotic temperature stress in wild-type and a corresponding starch-deficient mutant (phosphoglucomutase-deficient). Independent component analysis revealed phenotype classification resolving genotype-dependent response effects to temperature treatment and genotype-independent general temperature compensation mechanisms. An observation is the stress-induced increase of raffinose-family-oligosaccharide levels in the absence of transitory starch storage/mobilization in temperature-treated phosphoglucomutase plants indicating that sucrose synthesis and storage in these mutant plants is sufficient to bypass the typical starch storage/mobilization pathways under abiotic stress. Eventually, sample pattern recognition and correlation network topology analysis allowed for the detection of specific metabolite-protein co-regulation and assignment of a circadian output regulated RNA-binding protein to these processes. The whole concept of high-dimensional profiling data integration from many replicates, subsequent multivariate statistics for dimensionality reduction, and covariance structure analysis is proposed to be a major strategy for revealing central responses of the biological system under study.},

	abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature’) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

The MultiAssayExperiment software package, implemented in R and leveraging Bioconductor software and design principles, provides for the coordinated representation of, storage of, and operation on multiple diverse genomics data. We provide the unrestricted multiple �omics data for each cancer tissue in The Cancer Genome Atlas as ready-to-analyze MultiAssayExperiment objects and demonstrate in these and other datasets how the software simplifies data representation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-016-1455-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduction in the cost of genomic assays has generated large amounts of biomedical-related data. As a result, current studies perform multiple experiments in the same subjects. While Bioconductor�s methods and classes implemented in different packages manage individual experiments, there is not a standard class to properly manage different omic datasets from the same subjects. In addition, most R/Bioconductor packages that have been designed to integrate and visualize biological data often use basic data structures with no clear general methods, such as subsetting or selecting samples. RESULTS: To cover this need, we have developed MultiDataSet, a new R class based on Bioconductor standards, designed to encapsulate multiple data sets. MultiDataSet deals with the usual difficulties of managing multiple and non-complete data sets while offering a simple and general way of subsetting features and selecting samples. We illustrate the use of MultiDataSet in three common situations: 1) performing integration analysis with third party packages; 2) creating new methods and functions for omic data integration; 3) encapsulating new unimplemented data from any biological experiment. CONCLUSIONS: MultiDataSet is a suitable class for data integration under R and Bioconductor framework.
